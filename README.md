This repo hosts code for the tutorial about combining PixiJS and MediapipeJS libraries.
Link to the post will we shared later.

This Repo is based on a great PixiJS-webpack boilerplate https://github.com/proudcat/pixi-webpack-demo 
The `step-1-empty-project` branch of this repo corresponds with the master branch of that Repository at the moment of forking.
